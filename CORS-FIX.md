# CORS Fix Applied âœ…

## What Was Fixed

The backend now includes CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration to allow the frontend to make API requests.

## Changes Made

### Program.cs

Added CORS policy to allow requests from the frontend:

```csharp
// Add CORS
builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy("AllowFrontend", policy =>
    {
        policy.WithOrigins("http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3001")
              .AllowAnyMethod()
              .AllowAnyHeader();
    });
});

// ...

// Enable CORS
app.UseCors("AllowFrontend");
```

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Restart the Backend

Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C) and restart:

```bash
cd TodoApp
dotnet run
```

### Step 2: Refresh Frontend

If the frontend is already running, just refresh your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 3: Test

You should now see todos loading without CORS errors!

## What This Does

- **Allows Origins**: Permits requests from `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3001`
- **Any Method**: Allows GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- **Any Header**: Allows all headers (Content-Type, etc.)

## For Production

For production environments, you should:

1. **Restrict Origins** - Only allow your actual domain:
   ```csharp
   policy.WithOrigins("https://yourdomain.com")
   ```

2. **Use Environment Variables**:
   ```csharp
   var allowedOrigins = builder.Configuration
       .GetSection("AllowedOrigins")
       .Get<string[]>() ?? Array.Empty<string>();

   policy.WithOrigins(allowedOrigins)
   ```

3. **Add to appsettings.json**:
   ```json
   {
     "AllowedOrigins": ["https://yourdomain.com"]
   }
   ```

## Verification

After restarting, check the browser console. You should see:

âœ… **Before (Error):**
```
Response body is not available to scripts (Reason: CORS Missing Allow Origin)
```

âœ… **After (Success):**
```
[INFO] Fetching all todos
[INFO] Fetched 0 todos
```

## Additional Notes

### Why CORS?

CORS is a security feature in browsers that prevents JavaScript from making requests to a different domain than the one serving the page. Since:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend: `http://localhost:5000`

These are considered different origins (different ports), so CORS must be explicitly enabled.

### Security

The CORS policy is set to be permissive for development. In production:
- Use HTTPS
- Restrict to specific origins
- Consider additional security headers
- Use authentication/authorization

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

Your full-stack functional programming todo app should now work perfectly with the frontend communicating with the backend via CORS-enabled API calls!
